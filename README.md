## About

This project is the code implement of 《Research and application of classification method based on artificial intelligence method》, guided by the professor Liu Zhiping. It mainly studies the application of nine machine learning methods on classification problems.

## ABSTRACT

In recent years, with the rapid development of science and technology, Internet technology and information technology, especially the arrival of the big data information age, massive data information is flooding every field of our actual life. If big data is expected to generate substantial value and significance, the processing of big data is extremely important, and data classification is a key content in big data analysis and data mining. Various classification techniques and algorithms have been obtained. With the rapid development, the performance of various classification algorithms for different classification problems is different. This paper uses the IRIS data set and the WINE data set, using decision trees, K nearest neighbor classifiers, perceptrons, logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, Naive Bayesian, multi-layer perceptron, TSK fuzzy logic system and other algorithms were tested twice, and the performance indicators of various algorithms were compared and analyzed according to the experimental results.
